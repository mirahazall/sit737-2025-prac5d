- To build the docker image use: "docker build -t calculator-microservice ."

- Before publishing the docker image we need to do a test run on our development computer to make sure everything is in working order. 
- Once weâ€™ve packaged our microservice as a Docker image, we can use the docker run command below to instantiate it as a container. 
- docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e PORT=3000 calculator-microservice 
- This creates a local instance of our microservice that we can then test using a web browser.

- Use "docker-compose up -d" command to create the container with the image we created and start it.
- This command will read the docker-compose.yml file, pull the necessary images if they're not already available locally, create the containers, and start them.

- To push a Docker image to a container registry (Docker hub in this case): 
- 1. We need to use "docker login" command to login to docker
- 2. We need to use "docker tag calculator-microservice mirahazall64/calculator-microservice:latest" command to tag our local Docker image to associate it with a specific repository in Docker Hub.
- 3. We need to use "docker push mirahazall64/calculator-microservice:latest" to upload the tagged image to Docker Hub to make it accessible from anywhere.
